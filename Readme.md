# Guess The Number Game ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

Today, I used the teachings of the last few weeks to create a functional **Guess The Number** game. It was a great learning experience, and I faced some challenges along the way, which helped me understand JavaScript and the DOM better.

## Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned

1. **Reset Button Functionality**

   - I struggled with how to reset the page when the "Reset" button is clicked.
   - Learned about `location.reload()` and `location.replace()`, which help reload or navigate to a different page.

2. **DOM Manipulation Confusion**

   - Initially, working with the DOM felt confusing.
   - Storing elements in variables and using them later makes the code **shorter** and **easier to understand**.

3. **Using ID & Class Together**
   - Mixing both `id` and `class` for elements made it hard to manipulate them correctly.
   - From now on, I will **stick to either `id` or `class`** to keep things organized and avoid confusion.

## Conclusion

This project helped me apply JavaScript concepts in a practical way. I now have a better understanding of **event handling, DOM manipulation, and page reloading techniques**. Excited for more projects ahead! ðŸš€
